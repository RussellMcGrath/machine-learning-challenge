### Best Model file:
### DeepNN.h5 / DeepNN.sav - deep learning neural network with:
* 20 features
* 3 hidden layers
* 90 epochs
* batch size: 20
#### This model is about 87% accurate.

### Other model results:
* Decision Tree: testing data score: .583
* Random Forest (200 estimators): testing data score: .742
* k Nearest Neighbors (5 neighbors) testing data score: .481 (GridSearch improves to ~.60)
* SVM: model incomplete, takes too long to run
